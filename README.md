Hello,

I am @HunnyPuns. I write silly little programs, and plugins for Nagios and Nagios-like systems. Sometimes you can catch me on Twitch writing these plugins, or playing some games.

You can also find my Nagios plugins on the Nagios Exchange

And, now that Twitter sucks, you can find me on Mastadon.
